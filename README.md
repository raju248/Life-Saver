This is my 1st java project for Software Developement II course in 2nd year of my university.

Nowadays we see many post for blood on many social medias like Facebook, Twitter and Etc. Itâ€™s really hard to get blood from these social medias for many reasons.  Sometime it is hard to get blood even from blood banks and hospitals.  So, to help people to find blood easily, we are trying to make this software.  From this software people can easily find blood donor and information to contact with them. User can also post a request for blood and other user can see the request and contact with them from the provided information in the request. Beside user can see the nearby blood banks and the directions.
